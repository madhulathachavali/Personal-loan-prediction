# Personal-loan-prediction

The dataset contains data on 5000 customers, including their demographic data, relationship with the bank, and response to a prior personal loan campaign. Only 9.6% of the customers accepted the personal loan offered to them previously. The objective of the task is to predict the probability of a liability customer taking a personal loan. The Logistic Regression model was utilized for the prediction. People with education, experience, and having a CD account have high chance of taking loan . However, age and mortgage do not seem to have an impact on predicting the target variable. The focus is on recall since the goal is to increase the number of individuals accepting personal loans. The model achieved a training accuracy of 95% and a testing accuracy of 96%, along with a recall score of 66%.
