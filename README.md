# Personal-loan-prediction

The dataset comprises of information on 5000 customers, including their demographic data such as age and income, their relationship with the bank, such as securities accounts and mortgages, and their response to the prior personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Out of these 5000 customers, only 480 (9.6%) accepted the personal loan offered to them in the earlier campaign. The objective of the classification task is to forecast the probability of a liability customer taking a personal loan. Exploratory data analysis was employed to comprehend the data distribution of each attribute and target variable. A Logistic Regression model was utilized to predict whether or not a customer would opt for a personal loan. Following analysis, the most significant features were identified to be education, experience, and having a CD account. Conversely, age and mortgage appeared to have no impact on predicting the target variable. Since the aim is to enhance the number of individuals accepting personal loans, the focus is on recall, mainly because the target variable is 'Personal Loan.'
